This mod provides a simple ColorPicker for a mod.  It doesn't do anything by 
itself, it is a tool to be used by another mod.

This was originally written for use in the OSE Workshop, and is use by 
both OSE Workshop and the PWB Fuel Balander mods

Note that there is a Unity class called ColorPicker.  In order to differentiate
this mod, it's called KSP_ColorPicker
